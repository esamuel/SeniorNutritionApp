## üéôÔ∏è PART 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:45)
**Character Count: 1,247**

Hello, and welcome to the Senior Nutrition App! My name is Sarah, and I'm absolutely delighted to be your guide today. 

In this video, we're going to walk through setting up your personal profile together. Now, I know what you might be thinking - 'Why do I need to fill out all this information?' Well, here's the wonderful thing about your profile: it's like giving the app a personal introduction to you. 

The more the app knows about your health, your preferences, and your goals, the better it can help you. Think of it as having a personal nutrition assistant who knows exactly what you need.

Don't worry one bit if technology isn't your strongest suit. We'll take this step by step, nice and slow, and I promise you - you can always go back and change any information later. There's no such thing as making a mistake here.

So, let's get started on this journey together!

## üéôÔ∏è PART 2: NAVIGATION TO PROFILE (0:45 - 1:15)
**Character Count: 772**

First things first - let's find where to set up your profile. Look at your screen and you'll see some Quick Actions - these are convenient shortcuts to the most important features. Look for one that says Profile or has a person icon. You should be able to see it right on your main screen.

Perfect! Go ahead and tap on that Profile quick action now.

Excellent! This takes you directly to your profile area. If this is your very first time using the app, you might see a welcome screen that guides you through the setup. Either way is perfectly fine.

Now, look for a button that says Edit Profile or Setup Profile. Found it? Great! Let's tap that and begin our profile setup journey.

## üéôÔ∏è PART 3: PERSONAL INFORMATION - PART A (1:15 - 2:15)
**Character Count: 1,524**

Wonderful! Now we're looking at the personal information section. This is where we tell the app who you are. Think of this as introducing yourself to a new friend.

Let's start with your first name. I can see there's a box that says 'First Name'. Go ahead and tap in that box, and then type your first name. For our example today, I'm going to use the name 'Margaret'. 

Beautiful! Now let's move to the last name box. Tap there and enter your family name. I'll type 'Johnson' for our example.

Next up is your date of birth. Now, this might seem personal, but here's why it's so important: your nutritional needs change as we get older, and the app wants to give you advice that's perfect for your stage of life. 

Tap on the date field, and you'll see what we call a 'date picker' appear. You can scroll to find your birth month, day, and year. Take your time with this - there's no rush at all. For our example, I'm selecting March 15th, 1955.

## üéôÔ∏è PART 4: PERSONAL INFORMATION - PART B (2:15 - 3:00)
**Character Count: 1,098**

Last in this section is gender. You'll see options for Male, Female, or Other. This helps the app calculate your daily calorie needs more accurately, because men and women have different nutritional requirements. I'll select 'Female' for Margaret.

Now here's something very important I want you to know: all of this information stays completely private on your phone. The Senior Nutrition App doesn't share your personal details with anyone. This is just between you and your app.

We've just completed the personal information section! You're doing wonderfully. Let's move on to the next part where we'll add your physical measurements. Remember, this information helps the app give you the most accurate nutrition advice possible.

---

## üéôÔ∏è PART 5: PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS - PART A (3:00 - 3:45)
**Character Count: 1,456**

Now we're moving to the physical measurements section. I know some people feel a bit sensitive about sharing their height and weight, but remember - this is just for you, and it helps the app give you the most accurate nutrition advice possible.

Let's start with height. Tap on the height box. You can enter this in centimeters or in feet and inches - whatever feels more comfortable to you. There should be a little button to switch between the two. For our example, I'm going to enter 165 centimeters. If you prefer feet and inches, that would be about 5 feet and 5 inches.

Now for weight. Again, you can use kilograms or pounds - whichever you prefer. I'm entering 70 kilograms for Margaret, which is about 154 pounds. 

Remember, you don't need to be exact to the ounce or gram. The app just needs a good general idea to help with its calculations. And if your weight changes over time, you can always come back and update this information.

---

## üéôÔ∏è PART 6: PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS - PART B (3:45 - 4:30)
**Character Count: 1,623**

Now here's a really important one: Activity Level. This tells the app how active you are in your daily life. Let me explain each option:

Sedentary means you spend most of your day sitting, with very little exercise. 

Lightly Active means you do light exercise like walking or gentle household activities 1 to 3 days a week.

Moderately Active means you exercise regularly, about 3 to 5 days per week.

Very Active means you exercise hard almost every day.

Be honest with yourself here. For our example, I'm choosing 'Lightly Active' because Margaret takes daily walks and does some gardening. Pick the one that really describes your typical week.

Great job! You've completed the physical measurements section. This information is so valuable because it helps the app calculate exactly how many calories you need each day and what kind of nutrition advice will work best for your lifestyle.

## üéôÔ∏è PART 7: HEALTH CONDITIONS - PART A (4:30 - 5:15)
**Character Count: 1,536**

Now we're getting to a really valuable part - your health information. This section is completely optional, but if you choose to fill it out, the app can give you wonderfully personalized advice.

Let's look at medical conditions first. You'll see a list of common conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and others. Simply tap on any that apply to you. Don't worry - you're not diagnosing yourself, you're just sharing information you already know about your health.

For our example with Margaret, I'm going to select 'High Blood Pressure' and 'Type 2 Diabetes' because these are common conditions that many seniors manage.

If you have a health condition that's not on the list, look for a button that says 'Add Custom' and you can type it in yourself.

Now, why is this so helpful? Well, when you start logging your meals, the app will give you specific advice. For example, if you have high blood pressure like Margaret, it might gently warn you about foods that are high in sodium.

## üéôÔ∏è PART 8: HEALTH CONDITIONS - PART B (5:15 - 6:00)
**Character Count: 1,104**

Or if you have diabetes, it will help you keep track of carbohydrates. The app becomes your personal nutrition coach, helping you make choices that support your specific health needs.

Next, let's look at dietary restrictions. This is for things like vegetarian diets, gluten-free, lactose intolerant, or any food allergies you might have. For Margaret, I'm adding 'Low Sodium' since she has high blood pressure, and 'Diabetic Diet' to help manage her diabetes.

Remember, you can add, remove, or change any of this information anytime your health situation changes. The app grows and learns with you.

You're doing such a great job! We're more than halfway through setting up your profile. Next, we'll add emergency contacts - one of my favorite safety features of this app.

---

## üéôÔ∏è PART 9: EMERGENCY CONTACTS (6:00 - 7:15)
**Character Count: 1,899**

Now let's set up your emergency contacts. This is one of my favorite safety features of the Senior Nutrition App, and it's especially important for those of us who are getting a bit older.

Let's add your first emergency contact. Look for a button that says 'Add Emergency Contact' and tap that.

You'll see three boxes to fill out. First is the name. For Margaret, I'm going to enter 'John Johnson' - let's say that's her husband.

Next is the relationship. Tap on that dropdown menu and you'll see options like Spouse, Child, Parent, Friend, Doctor, and others. I'll select 'Spouse'.

Finally, the phone number. Enter the complete phone number, including the area code. Make sure this is a number where this person can actually be reached.

Let's add one more contact - it's always good to have backup. I'll tap 'Add Emergency Contact' again. This time, I'm adding 'Dr. Sarah Wilson' as the name, selecting 'Doctor' as the relationship, and entering the doctor's office phone number.

You might want to add an adult child, a close friend, or a neighbor - anyone who would want to know if you needed help. These contacts can be quickly reached if there's ever an emergency, and family members might need to know about your medications or health information.

I recommend having at least two contacts - one family member or close friend, and your doctor's office.

---

## üéôÔ∏è PART 10: ADVANCED SETTINGS (7:15 - 8:30)
**Character Count: 1,667**

Almost finished! Let's look at the advanced settings. Now, don't let the word 'advanced' worry you - the app chooses excellent defaults, but I want to show you what's there.

First, there's something called BMR Formula. BMR stands for 'Basal Metabolic Rate' - that's just a fancy way of saying how many calories your body needs every day just to keep working, even if you stayed in bed all day.

The app can use different mathematical formulas to calculate this. You'll see one called 'Mifflin-St Jeor' - and that's the most accurate formula for most people. The app has already selected this as the default, so we'll just leave it as is.

Based on all the information you've entered, the app will now calculate personalized daily calorie recommendations just for you. You'll see this number appear automatically - isn't that wonderful?

Before we finish, let's take a moment to review everything. Scroll back up through the sections we've completed. Look over your personal information, your measurements, your health conditions, and your emergency contacts. If you see anything you'd like to change, just tap on that section and make your adjustments.

When everything looks perfect to you, scroll down to the bottom and look for a big button that says 'Save Profile'. When you're ready, go ahead and tap that.

Excellent! You should see a confirmation that your profile has been saved successfully.

## üéôÔ∏è PART 11: CONCLUSION (8:30 - 9:00)
**Character Count: 1,394**

Congratulations! You have just successfully set up your complete personal profile in the Senior Nutrition App. Give yourself a pat on the back - you've accomplished something really important today!

Look at your screen now - you can see the app is showing information that's personalized just for you. That's the power of having a complete profile.

Let me remind you of a few important things:

You can edit your profile anytime by going to the Profile quick action, then Edit. Nothing is set in stone.

The more accurate your information is, the better recommendations the app can give you.

Your health conditions help the app give you specific, helpful nutritional advice.

And those emergency contacts? They're there for your safety and peace of mind.

In our next video, we're going to show you how to track your very first meal using all this wonderful profile information you've just set up. You're going to love seeing how the app uses what it knows about you to give you personalized nutrition advice.

Thank you so much for watching, and congratulations again on taking this important step toward better health management. I'll see you in the next video!
