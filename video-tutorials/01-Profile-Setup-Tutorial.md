**NARRATOR:**
"Welcome to Senior Nutrition App! I'm excited to show you how to set up your personal profile. Your profile is the foundation of this app - it helps us provide you with accurate nutrition recommendations, medication reminders, and health insights tailored specifically for you.

Don't worry, we'll go through this step by step, and you can always change any information later. Let's get started!"

### SECTION 1: ACCESSING PROFILE SETUP (0:45 - 1:15)

**NARRATOR:**
"First, let's find the profile setup. You can access this by tapping the 'More' tab at the bottom, then selecting 'Profile' or 'Settings'. 

If this is your first time using the app, you might see a setup wizard that guides you directly here. Either way works perfectly!"

### SECTION 2: PERSONAL INFORMATION (1:15 - 3:00)

**[VISUAL: Personal Information section of the profile form]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Now we'll start with your basic personal information. This helps the app calculate your nutritional needs accurately.

**First Name and Last Name:**
Let's enter your first name here. I'll type 'Margaret' as an example. And last name - I'll use 'Johnson'. This personalizes your experience and helps with medication reminders.

**Date of Birth:**
Next, let's set your birth date. This is important because nutritional needs change with age. Tap on the date field, and you'll see a date picker. I'll set this to show someone who's 68 years old.

**Gender:**
Select your gender here - the options are Male, Female, or Other. This affects how we calculate your daily calorie needs. I'll select 'Female' for our example.

Remember, all this information stays private on your device - we're not sharing it with anyone."

**[VISUAL: Show each field being filled out slowly and clearly]**

**Key Actions:**
1. Tap first name field ‚Üí Type name
2. Tap last name field ‚Üí Type name  
3. Tap date of birth ‚Üí Use date picker

### SECTION 3: PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS (3:00 - 4:30)

**[VISUAL: Height and weight input sections]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Now let's add your physical measurements. This information is crucial for calculating your daily calorie needs and giving you accurate nutrition advice.

**Height:**
Tap on the height field. You can enter this in centimeters or feet and inches - whatever you're comfortable with. I'll enter 165 centimeters, which is about 5 feet 5 inches.

**Weight:**
For weight, again you can use kilograms or pounds. I'll enter 70 kilograms, which is about 154 pounds. 

Don't worry about being exact - you can always update this information as it changes. The app will use the most recent measurements for its calculations.

**Activity Level:**
This is really important! Select how active you are in your daily life:
- Sedentary: Mostly sitting, minimal exercise
- Lightly Active: Light exercise 1-3 days per week
- Moderately Active: Moderate exercise 3-5 days per week
- Very Active: Hard exercise 6-7 days per week

I'll select 'Lightly Active' for our example, which fits many seniors who take daily walks or do light household activities."

**Key Actions:**

### SECTION 4: HEALTH CONDITIONS (4:30 - 6:00)

**[VISUAL: Medical conditions selection interface]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Next, let's add any health conditions you have. This is optional, but very helpful for getting personalized nutrition advice.

**Medical Conditions:**
The app includes common conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and others. Simply tap to select any that apply to you. For our example, I'll select 'High Blood Pressure' and 'Diabetes'.

If you have a condition that's not listed, you can tap 'Add Custom' and type it in yourself.

**Why is this important?**
When you log your meals, the app will give you specific advice. For example, if you have high blood pressure, it might warn you about foods high in sodium, or if you have diabetes, it will help you monitor carbohydrates.

**Dietary Restrictions:**
Similarly, if you have any dietary restrictions - like vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose intolerant, or allergies - add them here. I'll add 'Low Sodium' since our example person has high blood pressure.

Remember, you can add, remove, or modify these anytime as your health situation changes."

**[VISUAL: Show selecting conditions and adding custom ones]**

**Key Actions:**
1. Review available medical conditions

### SECTION 5: EMERGENCY CONTACTS (6:00 - 7:15)

**[VISUAL: Emergency contacts section]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Now let's add emergency contacts. This is a safety feature that's especially important for seniors.

**Adding Your First Emergency Contact:**
Tap 'Add Emergency Contact'. Let's add a primary contact:
- Name: I'll enter 'John Johnson' - perhaps a spouse or adult child
- Relationship: I'll select 'Spouse' from the dropdown
- Phone Number: Enter the complete phone number including area code

**Adding Additional Contacts:**
You can add multiple emergency contacts. Let's add another one:
- Name: 'Dr. Sarah Wilson'
- Relationship: 'Doctor'  
- Phone Number: Your doctor's office number

**Why Emergency Contacts Matter:**
These contacts can be quickly accessed if you need help, and family members might need this information if you're using the app to track medications or health data they should know about.

You should add at least one family member or friend, and consider adding your doctor's office as well."

**[VISUAL: Show adding multiple contacts with different relationship types]**

### SECTION 6: ADVANCED SETTINGS (7:15 - 8:30)

**[VISUAL: BMR formula and calorie calculation settings]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Finally, let's look at some advanced settings. Don't worry - the app chooses good defaults, but you can customize these if you want.

**BMR Formula:**
BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate - basically how many calories your body needs just to function. The app can use different formulas to calculate this. The default 'Mifflin-St Jeor' formula is accurate for most people, so we'll leave that selected.

**Calorie Goals:**
Based on all the information you've entered, the app will calculate personalized daily calorie recommendations. You can see this will be automatically calculated for you.

**Review Your Information:**
Before we finish, let's scroll back through and make sure everything looks correct. You can tap any section to make changes.

**Saving Your Profile:**
When everything looks good, tap 'Save Profile' at the bottom. Great! Your profile is now complete."

1. **Clear Pronunciation:** Speak slowly and clearly
2. **Explain Technical Terms:** Define BMR, calorie goals, etc.
